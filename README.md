Use this simple Bash script to convert `.m3u` playlist files to `.pls`. Here’s how you can do it. First, let’s assume the `.m3u` file format looks something like this:

### How to use:
1. Save the script in a file, e.g., `convert_m3u_to_pls.sh`.
2. Make it executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x convert_m3u_to_pls.sh
   ```
3. Run the script with the `.m3u` file as input:
   ```bash
   ./convert_m3u_to_pls.sh your_playlist.m3u
   ```

This script will generate a `.pls` file from the provided `.m3u` playlist file.
